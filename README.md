The plugin changes the status of your community server to "Official DS".

Adds the ability to connect to your server via friends list in the game lobby, and POSSIBLY via Steam (not tested).

IMPORTANT:
GSLT token (sv_setsteamaccount) must be specified for the plugin to work correctly, otherwise there will be an error when connecting through the lobby.
In addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/core.json set FollowCS2ServerGuidelines to false
